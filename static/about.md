# About :hub
**:hub** - Genomes on a Tree is built using [GenomeHubs 2.0](https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs) to present genome-relevant metadata for **all Eukaryotic taxa** across the tree of life.

**:hub** uses the [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) as the default backbone taxonomy, and adds synonyms from the following sources: [Open Tree of Life ](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/opentree13.4@ott304358/Eukaryota), [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/search), and [IRMNG](https://www.irmng.org/index.php). Alternative backbone taxonomies will be implemented in the near future.

Metadata in GoaT include, genome assembly attributes, genome sizes, C values, and chromosome numbers from [multiple sources](/sources).
