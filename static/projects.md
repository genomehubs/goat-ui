# Projects

GoaT hosts dedicated pages for the [Earth Biogenome Project](https://www.earthbiogenome.org) (EBP) and EBP-affiliated projects. Each project page contains information about the project, including its GoaT search term and BioProject ID together with reports of highlighting the planning, progress and completion of genome assemblies.

**Note** GoaT can only import data for taxa associated with a TaxID in the [NCBI Taxonomy database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy). All sources used for import, including complete lists of species, can be found in the [GoaT S3 Bucket](https://goat.cog.sanger.ac.uk/#sources/status-lists/).
