## Project Lists

EBP-affiliated projects and smaller projects under any INSDC umbrella bioproject can submit target lists and sequencing status to GoaT.

**Note** that some attributes in GoaT are under testing phase. Guidelines for file preparation might change over time to best accomodate project requirements. Guidelines on this page will always represent the latest version.

## Genome Metadata

GoaT curators are actively seeking trusted sources of genome-relevant metadata. If you have a dataset that you would like us to index in GoaT, or a suggestion for additional data you think should be included, please contact goat@genomehubs.org.

The [sources page](/sources) provides a summary of the current sources indexed by GoaT and the full dataset included in the latest and previous releases is available from [GoaT-data](https://github.com/genomehubs/goat-data).

## Submissions FAQs:

:::grid{container direction="row" toggle title="My lab is currently sequencing only a few genomes. Can I submit intent and progress to GoaT?" spacing="1"}

::grid[Yes. GoaT can import lists of intent and progress of smaller projects as long as those are registered under an umbrella [bioproject](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/docs/faq/) ID on INSDC and ideally linked to at least one major Earth Biogenome Project Umbrella. Projects should contact one of the major [initiatives](/projects) that best fit with their scope to be listed as a contributing lab]{item xs=12 .paragraph}

:::grid{container direction="row" toggle title="My project already has a data portal with a list of targets and detailed progress tracking. Can GoaT retrieve my data from the portal instead?" spacing="1"}

::grid[Yes. GoaT can access APIs and live documents and translate progress information into "GoaT-specific" terms. Reach out to [our curators](/help/contact) to arrange direct data transfers between systems.]{item xs=12 .paragraph}

:::

:::grid{container direction="row" toggle title="Our project is building a data portal to display progress. Can our site display live data and reports from the project pages on GoaT?" spacing="1"}

::grid[Yes. GoaT links from UI searches are equivalent to links from GoaT API endpoints and those can be used to feed other data systems. Reports from any metadata, including those on the [project-dedicated pages](/projects), can be retrieved from GoaT; their embeddable links can be used directly in other project portals.]{item xs=12 .paragraph}
