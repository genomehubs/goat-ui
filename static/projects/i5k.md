# i5K Initiative (i5k)

**GoaT Search Term:** i5K

The **i5K initiative** has a broad and inclusive mandate. Their goals are to:

- Organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species;
- Provide guidelines and best practices for arthropod genome projects and their data management;
- Help existing and new arthropod genome projects to find the most appropriate repository for their needs;
- Grow a community around arthropod genomes that works towards improved sequencing, assembly, annotation, and data management standards.
  For more information access the i5k's [project page](http://i5k.github.io) and [workspace](https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/).

**Bioproject ID** PRJNA163993

**Main Contact**: [i5k Workspace](i5k@ars.usda.gov)

# Summary Data

## i5K Long List

i5K long_list correspond to the subset of species declared as targets by the project. To retrieve the list use the search terms:

- long_list=i5K
- tax_rank(species)
