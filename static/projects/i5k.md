# i5K Initiative (i5k)

**GoaT Search Term:** i5K

The **i5K initiative** has a broad and inclusive mandate. Their goals are to:
 - Organize the sequencing and analysis of the genomes of 5,000 arthropod species;
 - Provide guidelines and best practices for arthropod genome projects and their data management;
 - Help existing and new arthropod genome projects to find the most appropriate repository for their needs;
 - Grow a community around arthropod genomes that works towards improved sequencing, assembly, annotation, and data management standards.
 For more information access the i5k's [project page](http://i5k.github.io) and [workspace](https://i5k.nal.usda.gov/).
