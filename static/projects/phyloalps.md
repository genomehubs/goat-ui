# Summary Data

## PHYLOALPS Long List

PHYLOALPS long_list correspond to the subset of species declared as targets by the project. Note that the **project status will not advance past sample_acquired** and the species list retrieved serve as a list of species for which the project might have sample or species information available.
To retrieve the list use the search terms:

- long_list=PHYLOALPS
- tax_rank(species)
