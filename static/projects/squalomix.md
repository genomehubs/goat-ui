# SQUALOMIX - Genome Sequencing and Assembly of Chondrichthyans
**GoaT Search Term:** SQUALOMIX


::grid[**SQUALOMIX** aims at unveiling the unique evolutionary trajectory of chondrichthyans (sharks, rays, and chimaeras) and is sustained by tight collaborations involving academic sequencing core facilities, marine stations, and public aquariums. By means of multimodal omics and molecular evolutionary approaches, it tackles biological questions in various fields including developmental biology and comparative physiology.

**Bioproject ID:** PRJNA707598

**Main Contact**: [Shigehiro Kuraku](skuraku@nig.ac.jp), National Institute of Genetics, in Mishima, Japan
