# Ancient Environmental Genomics Initiative for Sustainability (AEGIS)

**GoaT Search Term:** AEGIS

**Scope:** _High-quality reference genome sequencing and other sequencing_

::grid[**AEGIS** The Ancient Environmental Genomics Initiative for Sustainability (AEGIS), jointly funded by the NovoNordisk Foundation and the Wellcome Trust, is a global consortium led by the Globe Institute at the University of Copenhagen. AEGIS aims to develop the essential science and methodology to use ancient environmental DNA (eDNA) – coupled with other ancient and modern biomolecule-based approaches – to identify important organismal associations and genetic adaptations in natural and agro-ecosystems that will improve future food security under climate change.]{size=12}

::grid[_As part of AEGIS, the Tree of Life Programme will substantially enhance the available reference library to support eDNA analysis_, through targeted sequencing of agroecosystem species and relevant soil metagenomic samples. The species chosen for reference genome generation will represent the known and expected members of agricultural, grassland and riparian ecosystems, including dominant and keystone species, crop pathogens, rhizosphere symbionts and soil invertebrates. Additionally, sequencing near relatives of crops and revealing their ecosystem adaptations may inform analysis of crop resilience. For more information reach the contact info below.]{size=12}
