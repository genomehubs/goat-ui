# Summary Data

## OGG Long List

The OGG targets 35+ species, representing major evolutionary lineages in the land plant tree of life.
OGG long list on GoaT corresponds to all declared targets in the [OGG target list](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/ogg/) with available ncbi taxonomy IDs. To retrieve the list use the search terms:

- long_list=OGG
- tax_rank(species)
