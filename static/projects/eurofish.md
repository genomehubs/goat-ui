# The Euro-Fish Project
**GoaT Search Term:** EUROFISH 

::grid[**Euro-Fish** aims to create a genomic survey of all species of freshwater fishes of Europe in order to understand and avert the loss of biodiversity. The MPI-CBG and the CSBD are contributing to the EURO-Fish initiative together with the University of Konstanz, Germany, the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology & Inland Fisheries Berlin, and the Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig, Berlin. The Max Planck Society is funding this ambitious genome sequencing project. For more information access the Euro-Fish's MPI-CBG project page at https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research/our-research/institutional-research-consortia/the-euro-fish-project]{item xs=8}
