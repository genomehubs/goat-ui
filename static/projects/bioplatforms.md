# Bioplatforms Australia (BIOPLATFORMS)

**GoaT Search Term:** BIOPLATFORMS

::grid[**Bioplatforms Australia** is a non-profit organisation that supports Australian Life science research by investing in state-of-the-art infrastructure and expertise in genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and bioinformatics. This is made possible through investment funding provided by the Commonwealth Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). Their mission is to enhance these research capabilities, support innovation and help transform scientific outcomes into tangible benefits for Australians.

### Projects contributing assemblies to Bioplatforms Australia Umbrella.

::grid[**Bioplatforms Australia** develops scientific initiatives and collaborations of national significance across medicine, agriculture and environmental science. Transformative research projects supported by Bioplatforms Australia are diverse and range from the first ever sequencing of the Australian koala genome, a systematic coverage of Australian native vertebrates and native flora, agriculture-linked plants and pathogens and the worldâ€™s largest coral genomics sequencing project on the Great Barrier Reef.]{size=8}
