# The Vertebrate Genomes Project (VGP)

**GoaT Search Term:** VGP

::grid[**VGP** aims to producing high-quality, accurate, annotated reference genomes for all [71,657](http://vgpdb.snu.ac.kr/splist/) living and named vertebrate species. Phase I of the project will generate over 260 near-gapless, chromosome-level and phased genome assemblies representing all extant vertebrate orders. For more information access the VGP's project page at https://vertebrategenomesproject.org]{item xs=8}
