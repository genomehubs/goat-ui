# Wise Ancestors (WA)

**GoaT Search Term:** WA

# Scope: 
The [Wise Ancestors platform](https://www.wiseancestors.org/) interweaves genomic sequencing, biobanking, and Indigenous Knowledge to create, fund and complete Conservation Challenges, accelerating the conservation of Earth's biodiversity for the benefit of all.

::grid[**Wise Ancestors** is committed to co-creating and developing species-specific research projects (ie. “Conservation Challenges”) with Indigenous Peoples (IP) and Local Communities (LC) for the purpose of producing genomic information, strengthening IP and LC conservation efforts, and supporting Indigenous data sovereignty. Our goal is to contribute to worldwide efforts to significantly slow the rate of biodiversity loss while uplifting IP and LC leadership. For more information reach the contact info below.]{size=8}
