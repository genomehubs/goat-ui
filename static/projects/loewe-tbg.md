# LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (LOEWE-TBG)

**GoaT Search Term:** LOEWE-TBG

::grid[**The LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics** focuses on the genetic basis of biological diversity to make it accessible for basic and applied research. At LOEWE-TBG we sequence and study genomic variation across the tree of life to comprehend the origin and functional adaptations of diversity from genes to ecosystems. The data addresses societal knowledge demands in applied fields, such as the genomic basis of biologically active substances , and the sustainable use and management of biological resources. For more information access LOEWE-TBG official page at https://tbg.senckenberg.de]{item xs=12}

**Bioproject ID** PRJNA706923
