# The California Conservation Genomics Project (CCGP)

**GoaT Search Term:** CCGP

::grid[**CCGP** is a state-funded initiative with a single goal: to produce the most comprehensive, multispecies, genomic dataset ever assembled to help manage regional biodiversity. The CCGP brings together many of Californiaâ€™s leading experts, working at the interface of genomics and conservation science, to provide decision makers with cutting-edge genomic resources and analyses. Our resources will inform conservation decisions in the face of rapidly accelerating species declines. For more information access the CCGP's project page at https://www.ccgproject.org/]{size=8}

**Bioproject ID** PRJNA720569

**Main Contact:** [Courtney A. Miller](https://www.ccgproject.org/contact), CCGP Fund and Project Manager;
