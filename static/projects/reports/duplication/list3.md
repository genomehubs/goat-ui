### Criteria applied for search:

- species is collected or further in the {{project}}'s sequencing pipeline, but not yet submitted
- species has been at least collected by one or more additional projects in GoaT
- an assembly meeting [EBP standard criteria](https://github.com/genomehubs/goat-data/wiki/5-Earth-Biogenome-Project-(EBP)-FAQs#how-are-ebp-standard-criteria-and-dates-calculated) has not been published
- an assembly might exist in INSDC, but does not meet EBP standard criteria

**EBP suggestion:** consider coordination with identified [project representatives](/projects) to avoid duplication or to improve existing assemblies.
