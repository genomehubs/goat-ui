# Global Invertebrate Genomics Alliance (GIGA)

**GoaT Search Term:** GIGA

::grid[**GIGA** is building a network of scientists to tackle challenges associated with genome and transcriptome sequencing and promote standards that will facilitate comparative approaches to invertebrate genomics.

# Summary Data

## Tree representing species for which GIGA has generated assemblies
The data displayed in this tree originated from a manual compilation. GIGA assemblies will be linked to the umbrella Bioproject ID PRJNA649812. Please [contact GIGA](/http://www.gigacos.org/) if you wish to submit genomes under GIGA umbrella.
