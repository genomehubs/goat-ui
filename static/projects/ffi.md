# Australian Functional Fungi Initiative (FFI)

**GoaT Search Term:** FFI

::grid[**The Australian Functional Fungi Initiative (FFI)** aims to create comprehensive genomic, metabolomic, and proteomic data to advance understanding and innovation in Australian fungi. By uncovering novel fungi taxa and their functions, the initiative seeks to support fundamental research, industry translation, and applications in areas such as health, environment, conservation, and agri-food. Bioplatforms is enabled by the Commonwealth Government National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). For more information access https://bioplatforms.com/projects/fungi/]{size=8}
