The MetaInvert database serves to improve species identification through shotgun metagenomics, to reveal evolutionary relationships, special adaptations, and host-microbiome associations.
Sequences were generated within Senckenberg and the LOEWE Centre for Translational Biodiversity Genomics (TBG) with funding from LOEWE in the MetaInvert project, and as part of the Central-European Soil Invertebrate Genome Initiative (SIGI).
