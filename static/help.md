# Help

The values in this GenomeHub are shown alongside a color-coding system to indicate which are based on :span[direct]{.direct} measurements, which are inferred from :span[descendant]{.descendant} taxa and which are inferred from sibling taxa via a shared :span[ancestor]{.ancestor}. For this last category, tooltips provide details of the common ancestral rank to provide an indication of how reliable the estimate may be, e.g. :tooltip[:span[ancestor]{.ancestor}]{title="family" arrow placement="right"}.
